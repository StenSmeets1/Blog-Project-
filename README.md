## About/Features
Its a very basic implementation of a simple blog system. Using [Laravel](https://laravel.com/) for the backend, [Vue](https://vuejs.org/) for the frontend and [Inertiajs](https://inertiajs.com/) for the routing. 
<br>
<br>
The user can create posts, view posts, create an account and login. Each post has a views tab to see how many times a post has been viewed. A user themselves and users who are admins can delete their own/a post. The homescreen shows 3 random posts and a link to all the posts. 
<br>
<br>
The navbar is responsive and turns into a hamburger menu on smaller screens.
<br>
I use ToastUI for the create post editor this allows markdown and doubles as a WYSIWYG-Editor.
